This is a music application that has been done with React.js.
The app uses a java Spring back end found here: https://github.com/EmilKaidesoja/music-app-backend
It also uses the musixmatch api and the spotify web api and web player SDK. 

NOTE: ( The Spotify player SDK is still in beta and doesn't support mobile devices or tablets )

You can find this app on my Digital Ocean droplet at www.my-musicapp.me
