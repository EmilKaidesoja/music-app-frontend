This is a music application that has been done with React.js.
The app uses a Java Spring backend found here: https://github.com/EmilKaidesoja/music-app-backend, and musixmatch API for song listing and search, and the Spotify web player api for controls and playback.
With the app users can search for different songs, register accounts, save favorites and connect to the Spotify Web player API to play songs with.

NOTE: The Spotify Web Player requires a Spotify premium account.
